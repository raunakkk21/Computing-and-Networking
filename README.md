##  COMPUTATION ðŸ’»  
1.**CPU**- A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the most important component of a computer.It performs all types of data processing operations, including:

  - Arithmetic
  - Logic
  - Controlling
  - Input/output (I/O) operations
    

    
2.**ALU**- An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logic operations. It's a fundamental building block of a computer's central processing unit (CPU).ALUs perform operations on:
- Integer binary numbers
- Instruction words
- Bitwise operations
  
3.**DPU**- A data processing unit (DPU) is a programmable computer processor that integrates a CPU with network interface hardware. DPUs are also known as "IPUs" (infrastructure processing units) or "SmartNICs".DPUs are used in data centers to:
- Move data around
- Handle networking functions
- Relieve the CPU from data processing jobs

 4.**GPU**-A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a chip that renders graphics for display on an electronic device.GPUs are designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing.They can perform mathematical calculations at high speed. Computing tasks like: 
- Graphics rendering
- Machine learning (ML) 
- Video editing
  
5.**SOC**- A system on chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that combines many or all of the high-level function elements of an electronic device onto a single chip. SoCs are much smaller than multi-chip designs found in PCs or notebooks and consume less power, but are typically much slower.  
SoCs usually contain:
- CPU,GPU
- USB controller
- Power management circuits
- 
6.**FGPA**- FGPA stands for field-programmable gate array. It's a type of integrated circuit that can be programmed or reprogrammed after manufacturing.FPGAs are versatile and can be configured to perform a wide range of digital logic functions.
7.**ASICS**
-  ASIC stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. ASICs are computer chips that combine several different circuits on one chip. They are custom-built for a specific purpose, such as running in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency video codec.
-  ASICs are the opposite of CPUs and GPUs, which perform general operations. ASICs are more power efficient and have better performance than general purpose integrated circuits. ASICs are used in more specific applications, such as: Cryptocurrency mining, Network processing, Digital cameras.

## STORAGE
1.**RAID**- RAID stands for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks" or "Redundant Array of Independent Disks". It's a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units.  
RAID is used for:

- Data redundancy
- Performance improvement
- Storing the same idea in different places
- Applications that require high data read/write transfer rates for large sequential files
- Enabling the array to function, even if one drive were to fail
