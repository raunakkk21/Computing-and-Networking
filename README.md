- Smart navigation of vehicles
- Traffic load balancing
  
13.**Shakti Project**- The Shakti project is India's first indigenous microprocessor. It was designed by students at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Chennai. The project was started in 2014 by IIT Madras Director V Kamakoti and other researchers.The Shakti microprocessor is based on an open-source architecture, making it free for everyone to use. It was fabricated on 22nm FinFET, running at 400MHz and benchmark of 1.67 DMIPs/MHz.   
14.**SEP**-A standard-essential patent (SEP) is a patent that protects an invention that must be used to comply with a technical standard.    

15.**GraphineOS**- GrapheneOS is a custom, open-source operating system (OS) that focuses on privacy and security. It's based on Android and is compatible with Android apps.GrapheneOS is compatible with selected Google Pixel smartphones, including:   
- Pixel 8 Pro,Pixel 8,Pixel Fold,etc
